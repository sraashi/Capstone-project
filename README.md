### Modeling of Enzyme Inhibitors

Raashi Sreenivasan

#### Executive summary

#### Rationale
Why should anyone care about this question?
The main objective here to be able to predict how a compound may perform against a target using a set of available data. Drug discovery requires the screening of many 1000s of molecules to arrive at potent compounds that perform well amongst many parameters so I see a lot of potential where AI/ML can help increase efficiency here. 

#### Research Question
What are you trying to answer?
Classifying compounds as active or inactive from available physicochemical data. 

#### Data Sources
What data will you use to answer you question?
Physico-chemical data and 2D structure of compounds publicly available. 

#### Methodology
What methods are you using to answer the question?
I am using logistic regression, KNN and SVC to compare classification parameters. 

#### Results
What did your research find?
From logistic, KNN and SVC models fitting the data, KNN gave the highest accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. 
#### Next steps
What suggestions do you have for next steps?
Try other models, Bayes and Random forest to compare with what the authors have also reported in their paper.
